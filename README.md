Angry Birds like Game:
The game was made for my young primary school students at "ATID PLUSE" program which I teach in voluntarily. The game includes a player - plain, and birds. The player needs to shoot the birds, every sucssesfull shooting is a point more in his score , if the birds touches him the player loosses life. When the player has 0 life and a bird touches him the player losses and an image "you lost" will appear and he could only closed the game and that's it.
The player moves using the mouse and shoots using the left click in the mouse. The player can move up and down but he's movement to the left is limited.
Ways I can improve the game (hopefully will add all of this in the future):
•	give the player option to restart the game - working on that now
•	make the background move
•	more options to win lifes.
•	more interactions with objects.
•	diffrenet stages.
